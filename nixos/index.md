## NixOS Disclaimer

I've been working through these notes for a while now, but I finally feel like they're ready to share with others. As someone who's new to NixOS, I know how frustrating it can be when you get stuck - I definitely had my fair share of struggles! Luckily, I was able to find some helpful solutions online, from YouTube comments and user blogs that other beginners were sharing.

Honestly, NixOS can be pretty tricky, so don't worry if you see some mistakes in my writing - I'm still learning! I'll do my best to keep everything up to date, but no promises since I've got a real life outside of this too.
